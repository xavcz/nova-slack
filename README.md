Automatically send your posts as messages to any connected Slack Team.

1. You first need to create a [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/applications/new).

2. Configure the redirect URI as `http://your-telescope-app.com/add-to-slack`.

3. Register your App Client ID & App Client Secret to your Telescope Settings.

4. A wild "Add to Slack" button appeared in the footer of your app! Anyone can get your posts automatically in their Slack team, hooray!
